### With a Deep Learning Speech-to-Text Application

This is a Python application that receives a voice message from a caller, transcribe that message to text, then extract pertinent information to auto-fill a help request.

It was built for a SaaS company that provides customer service in unattended retail.

### What

I was tasked with utilizing the newly available deep learning tools to help, "replace the call center" to aid with customer service in unattended retail environments.

The application needed to answer a phone call from a consumer who needs assistance at a piece of unattended retail equipment.

The goal was to add an audio component to a text-based customer service application.

### Why

Unattended retail environments (micro-markets, electronic car charges, vending machines, etc.) often confront consumers with problems they do not have the time, tools, or expertise to solve. 

By introducing an asyncronic workflow for customer service in these retail environments, the SaaS company uses a text-based web application to create work orders and log issues automatically.

Some consumers prefer to call rather than text, so the company wanted to implement a speech-to-text element to "replace the call center".

### How

This project was coded in Python and connects to the OpenAI API to access their Large Language Models.

This was a proof of concpept which was then translated to a NodeJS web application.

### Dependencies:

Streamlit, Python, OpenAI
